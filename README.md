#BingBot
BingBot is a bot created to automatically search for gibberish on MS's bing.com.
It utilized capybara and webkit to log into bing and execute the searches. 
(bing requires javascript so mechanize was a no go).

Note: in order to set this up as a cron job you must use xvfb
Example: 0 8 * * * DISPLAY=localhost:1.0 xvfb-run /path/to/script/bingbot/bingbot.rb
